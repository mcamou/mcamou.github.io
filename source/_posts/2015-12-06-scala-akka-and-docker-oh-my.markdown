I've been selected to present at [Scala eXchange 2015](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/6862-scala-exchange-2015)! I will be talking about Docker, and how to use it to make life easier for Scala developers. Hope to see you there!

The presentation slides are [here](scala-akka-docker/). I will add the link to the presentation video after the fact.
