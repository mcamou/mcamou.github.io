I've been selected to present at [Scala eXchange 2015](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/6862-scala-exchange-2015)! I will be talking about Docker, and how to use it to make life easier for Scala developers. Hope to see you there!

The presentation slides are [here](/presentations/scala-akka-docker/). There is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy_dczUWgQo) of this same talk at the eBay Tech Talks.
